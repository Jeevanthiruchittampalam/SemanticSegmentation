Description from List of Projects:

Problem: This project focuses on semantic understanding of urban scenes for increasing the safety of
autonomous drone flight and landing procedures. The imagery depicts more than 20 houses from nadir
(bird's eye) view acquired at an altitude of 5 to 30 meters above ground. A high-resolution camera was
used to acquire images at a size of 6000x4000px (24Mpx). The training set contains 400 publicly available
images and the test set is made up of 200 private images. The dataset provides pixel-accurate annotation
for the same training and test set. The complexity of the dataset is limited to 20 classes
